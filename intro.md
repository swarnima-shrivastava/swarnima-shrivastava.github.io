# About Me

I have 12+ years of experience in **software engineering and tech leadership**, mentoring teams and guiding emerging professionals.  

Recently, I became a **Leadership Coach with Braven**, where I help individuals develop leadership skills, navigate careers, and achieve their goals.  

This portfolio is a collection of my:
- **Book summaries** – insights from leadership, product, and technical books
- **Project work** – side projects and experiments demonstrating tech and product thinking
- **Mentorship reflections** – lessons from coaching and mentoring

Feel free to explore, and connect if you want to collaborate or discuss leadership, tech, or mentorship!
